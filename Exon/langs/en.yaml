    The following options are possible:
    ‚Ä¢‚û• /welcomemute soft: Restricts new members from sending media for 24 hours.
    ‚Ä¢‚û• /welcomemute strong: Mutes new members till they tap on a button, thereby verifying they're human.

    ‚Ä¢‚û• /welcomemute off: Turns off welcomemute.
    
    *Note:* Strong mode kicks a user from the chat if they dont verify in 120seconds. They can always rejoin though.

welcome_help: |
    Your group's welcome/goodbye messages can be personalized in multiple ways. If you want the messages to be individually generated, like the default welcome message is, you can use *these* variables:
    
    ‚Ä¢‚û• {first}: This represents the user's *first* name.
    ‚Ä¢‚û• {last}: This represents the user's *last* name. Defaults to *first name* if user has no last name.
    ‚Ä¢‚û• {fullname}: This represents the user's *full* name. Defaults to *first name* if user has no last name.
    ‚Ä¢‚û• {username}: This represents the user's *username*. Defaults to a *mention* of the user's first name if has no username.
    ‚Ä¢‚û• {mention}: This simply *mentions* a user - tagging them with their first name.
    ‚Ä¢‚û• {id}: This represents the user's *id*
    ‚Ä¢‚û• {count}: This represents the user's *member number*.
    ‚Ä¢‚û• {chatname}: This represents the *current chat name*.

    Each variable MUST be surrounded by `{}` to be replaced.  
    Messages also support markdown, so you can make any elements bold/italic/code/links.
    Buttons are also supported, so you can make your welcomes look awesome with some nice intro buttons.

    To create a button linking to your rules, use this: `[Rules](buttonurl://t.me/{exon.bot.username}?start=group_id)`. 
    Simply replace group_id with your group's id, which can be obtained via /id. Be sure to mention the bot's username after the t.me.

    You can even set images/gifs/videos/voice messages as the welcome message by 
    replying to the desired media, and calling /setwelcome.
